# Aberystwyth PhD Thesis LaTex Template

**Disclaimer: This isn't the official template, I made this as part of writing my own thesis in LaTeX. You had better check that this template is fine with your spervisor first.**

## Producing a PDF file

Open `thesis-main.tex` with your favorite Latex editor (for example [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org)) and compile it. Bibliography entries are in the `references.bib` file.

## Producing a PDF file from the command line

The project uses a `Makefile` to produce the PDF output. More information about `make` and `Makefile` can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile). Type

```
make all
```

or just

```
make
```

to run both `pdflatex` and `bibtex` so that the final output includes the references as well. If you have already compiled the bibliography and you made modifications just to the Latex files, then you can type

```
make pdf
```

In case you want to update the bibliography type

```
make bibtex
```

To clean all the temporary files generated by Latex without removing any output, type

```
make clean
```

and to remove also the generated output files type

```
make allclean
```

Other `make` commands are:

* `make ps` to produce a ps file;
* `make printpdf` to have a PDF with embedded fonts;
* `make checkfonts` to check if fonts are embedded;
* `make docx` to produce a Word docx document;
* `make html` to produce a HTML document;
* `make odt` to produce a LibreOffice document;
